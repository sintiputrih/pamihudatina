Well here is a brief overview of the show: a group of contestants referred to as “Houseguests” from all around the world (mostly from the US) come together to live in a specially constructed house away from the outside world for a grand cash prize of $750 thousand. Houseguests are monitored always using live TV cameras and personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, houseguests are evicted from the house by being voted out. The one who survives the eviction till the last wins the show.</p><p>Besides Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli, the other 15 contestants of Big Brother 24 are <a href=#>Kyle Capener</a>, Paloma Aguilar, Monte Taylor, Jasmine Davis, Michael Bruner, Taylor Hale, Brittany Hoopes, Daniel Durston, Joseph Abdin, Terrance Higgins, Ameerah Jones, Matt Turner, Nicole Layog, Indy Santos, and Alyssa Snider.</p><p>Joe took to Instagram on July 7, 2022, and asked his fans and followers to tune into CBS and Paramount+ on the series premiere day and support him. He wrote, “The big day is finally here! Meet Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli, a 24-year-old assistant football coach from Staten Island, New York… Make sure you tune in tonight for the premiere of Big Brother 24 & get to see where Pooch is going to be spending his Summer! 8pm EST.”</p><p>The first live eviction episode of Big Brother 24 is scheduled for Thursday night July 14th and fortunately, Joe is safe for the week.

Joe was very open about avoiding any person who could explode at any second in his alliance. He revealed that he is a chill lackadaisical gut and getting such an aggressive person on the team could put their game at risk.</p><p>When asked about what other houseguests may dislike about him, his response was: “I think my likability, my being very personable will help me early on. But I think later on in the game that might hurt me.”</p><p>The Big Brother 24 star also shared that being an urban Italian-American, the other houseguests will perceive him the same way they would perceive any urban Italian-American early on in the game. However, he added eventually they will see that’s really not him and actually see him for who he actually is.</p><p>Furthermore, Joe told Parade.com about the best advice he received before coming out to play. It was about being a “trustworthy person, a caring, real person, being himself.” He shared that the advice came from his family.</p><h3><strong>Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli Age</strong></h3><p>Born in the year 1998, Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli’s age was 24 as of July 2022.</p><h3><strong>Is Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>According to heavy.com, Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli was single during the filming of the show and was not dating anyone.</p><h3><strong>Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli Height</strong></h3><p>Big Brother Season 24 star stands tall at a height of 5 feet 11 inches.</p><h3><strong>Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli Job</strong></h3><p>The Internet tells us that Joe “Pooch” Pucciarelli is an Assistant Football Coach by profession.
