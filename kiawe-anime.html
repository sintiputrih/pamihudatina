The next day, Kiawe and the others said farewell to Lillie, taking one last photo with her before she and her family left on a cruise ship. As he flew back home, Ash was greeted by his classmates and Alolan Pokémon, who flew by in their Ultra Guardians uniforms to give him one final farewell. Sometime later, Kiawe made one last delivery to <a href=# title="Aina's Kitchen">Aina's Kitchen</a> before leaving to begin his training with Olivia.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Journeys:_The_Series></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Journeys:_The_Series><i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i></span></h3><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN037>That New Old Gang of Mine!</a></i>, Kiawe attended the welcome party held to celebrate Ash and <a href=# title=Goh>Goh</a>'s visit to Alola. He was displeased upon hearing of how infrequently Ash and Goh battled each other, and as such, he later challenged Goh to battle to see if he was a worthy rival for Ash. During the battle, Goh snapped at Kiawe and told him that he wasn't Ash's rival, but rather just a friend and fellow <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Professors' aides">research fellow</a>. Kiawe used Inferno Overdrive on <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Goh's Raboot">Goh's Raboot</a>, but before the move could connect, he had Marowak pick it and Goh out of the way. Afterwards, Kiawe asked Goh to look after Ash, which he agreed to.</p><p>Kiawe is mentioned and seen in a fantasy in <i><a href=# title=JN096>Lighting the Way Home!</a></i>, where Sophocles told Goh that Kiawe was looking forward to battling Goh again.</p><p>When Lillie's family returned to Alola in <i><a href=# title=JN112>Helping the Hometown Hero!</a></i> after finding Mohn, Kiawe was revealed to have gone off to train instead of attending the party to celebrate Mohn's homecoming. The next day, Kiawe participated in a Battle Royal with Ash, Professor Kukui, and Gladion.
