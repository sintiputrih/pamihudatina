evidence that helped track the path of killers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson as they walked the two-year-old boy to his death on a railway line.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 70-year-old, who would have been 43 at the time, worked for an electric company and spent a lot of his days in the area around the Bootle Strand shopping centre from where young James was abducted from his mother by Venables and Thompson.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a bid to help the case, Alex used his in-depth knowledge of the surrounding streets to work out where the boys had gone and told people with security cameras to check their footage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His quick-thinking led to one company spotting the boys in their car park which helped police track down James’ body and later identify to the two killers.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Venables and Thompson were convicted of killed James and were jailed until they 18 when they were given new identities and released on&nbsp;lifelong licence.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-955e31ce47c56cdb

taken by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables as they abducted James Bulger from a Bottle shopping centre in 1993.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When he first heard the news about James being missing and as appeals were made across the city to help find the toddler, Alex said it ‘resonated’ with him as he had two young sons himself, who at the time were around five and eight years old.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘When they came on the television and radio looking for help, I was out of my mind,’ said Alex.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added: ‘It resonated with me – it could have been one of my lads, if you’re out shopping and young ones disappear for a second your heart sinks, so I felt for his mum.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Because of his work with local businesses, including the Triad Building on Stanley Road, Alex knew the area ‘intimately’ and after work one day he found himself instinctively following the route the boys could have gone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: ‘I was the contracting manager on the Triad Building, so the Strand was intimate to me and I knew if he was coming out that exit,&nbsp;if they’re going up there they’d want to get off Stanley Road straight away and turn up Park Street, and then the other road was just intuition.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-4e2b9cddcdfa7cd
