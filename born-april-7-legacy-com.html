She gained notoriety with her rendition of the protest song “Strange Fruit” and won fans with more mainstream work like “Miss Brown to You” and “When a Woman Loves a Man.” More than half a century after her death, Holiday is still considered one of the all-time greats, and her recordings endure as classics.

In a profession where passion and skill don’t always pay the bills, it’s a hugely important organization.

He replaced Skip Spence, who went on to start another Fillmore-era San Francisco rock group, Moby Grape. During his stint with the Airplane, Dryden had an affair with the band’s female vocalist, Grace Slick, and his marriage to the former Sally Mann was covered extensively in Rolling Stone magazine. He left the band in 1970. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>1936: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cynthia Lynn</strong></a>, Latvian-American actress who played Fraulein Helga on TV’s “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogan’s Heroes</a>,” is born in Riga, Latvia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.com/legacy/images/Portraits/Cynthia-Lynn-dead-170134275port.jpgx?w=117&h=151&option=1&v=0x000000002cd2ab39"><p>She was among the last surviving cast members of the 1960s military comedy. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><p><strong>1934: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ian Richardson</strong></a>, Scottish actor who was a top Shakespearean stage actor but was known best to many in the U.S. for asking, “Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?” in a series of mustard commercials, is born in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.com/legacy/images/Portraits/Ian-Richardson-dead-86373658port.jpgx?w=117&h=151&option=1&v=0x000000001907903c"><p>Richardson played the silkily evil Francis Urquhart in three miniseries, “House of Cards” in 1990, “To Play the King” in 1993, and “The Final Cut” in 1995.

He turned to acting after serving in the Navy, co-starring in “Stagecoach West” from 1960-61. But he’s known best for his iconic turn as Army surgeon Trapper John on “M*A*S*H,” one of the most popular series in the history of TV. His character’s wisecracks and high jinks with his on-air partner-in-crime, Alan Alda’s Hawkeye Pierce, landed him deep in the affections of the show’s fans, despite the fact that Rogers only appeared in the first three of the show’s 11 seasons. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read more</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>1932: Cal Smith</strong>, U.S. country music singer who had a hit in 1974 with “Country Bumpkin,” is born in Gans, Oklahoma.</p><p><strong>1928: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Alan J.

Pakula: His Films and His Life,” 2005) said that when Pakula sat next to people on planes, he would often tell them he was a psychiatrist, not a film director.

In that year, disgusted with the racism she saw all around her, she recorded “Strange Fruit.” The song’s bluntly poignant descriptions of southern lynchings were shocking and eye-opening, and it became Holiday’s deeply effective closing song for her live performances. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>1908: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Percy Faith</strong></a>, Canadian bandleader who popularized easy-listening music, is born in Toronto, Ontario.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.net/UserContent/ns/Photos/Faith_150x150.jpg><p>Faith began his career as a bandleader when the big band style was in its heyday. Gradually, he massaged the brassy big band sound into something different, something quieter, mellower, and with all the rough edges sanded off. He pulled brass instruments out of the mix and put the focus on the strings. Applying this technique to both original compositions and current popular music, he jump-started the popular “mood music” genre of the 1950s and ’60s – and won more than one Grammy for his efforts. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more</a></p><p><strong>1891: Ole Kirk Christiansen</strong>, Danish businessman who created the Lego toy, is born in Filskov, Denmark.</p><p><strong>1860: Will Keith Kellogg</strong>, U.S. industrialist who founded the Kellogg Co., is born in Battle Creek, Michigan.</p><p><strong>1770: William Wordsworth</strong>, English poet who was poet laureate of Britain from 1843 to 1850, is born in Cockermouth, England.</p><p><strong>1506: Francis Xavier</strong>, Basque Roman Catholic missionary who co-founded the Society of Jesus, is born in Xavier, Kingdom of Navarre.</p><p><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Discover notable people who died this day in history including the king of insult comics&nbsp;Don Rickles.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue86boK2tkafGcK7Oq6VmmaCntq15lmajnp%2BRmMZur86mZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./wicked-movies-cast-release-date-trailer-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Everything We Know About Wicked, If You Dare to Find Out</a>
