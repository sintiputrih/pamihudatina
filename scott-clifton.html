Scott Clifton Snyder is his given name. He was reared in Southern California’s Greater Los Angeles Area, including the Santa Clarita Valley and the San Fernando Valley, which he considered his hometown.&nbsp; Scott Clifton is the only child of Faye Snyder and Ron Snyder. As a result, he has no siblings. His father is of a “Russian Yiddish” background, while his mother is of Scots descent. As a result, he is of mixed ethnic origin. Scott is an American citizen. According to his birthdate, he is a Scorpio. Clifton is a devout atheist. He co-hosted episode 24.29 of The Atheist Experience with Matt Dillahunty on July 19, 2020.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Scott attended Valencia High School and later Beverly Hills High School, concentrating on his education. In an interview, he stated,</p><p>“High school was the worst time of my life, and I spent every bit of it figuring out how to get out, which I did.” I earned my GED and dropped out of high school in the mid-11th grade, I believe. I dropped out with a diploma, yet technically I am still a high school dropout. I was quite self-conscious. As you may have noticed, I lacked social skills. A small part of it was that I grew up in a very secular, non-religious/philosophical environment, and my family relocated to this highly evangelical Christian neighborhood shortly before high school, so I was somewhat on the outside in that way. I became something of a sucker for apologetic arguments, and everyone was continually pleading with me to join them at church, which I did, but high school was a very, very uncomfortable time for me. I struggled in school. I did not earn a good grade. I was an intelligent child, but I despised all of the tasks. I despised performing them; I couldn’t see the point. I knew I would never pursue anything intellectual with my life, which is strange given that after high school, I began truly educating myself and reading about subjects I was interested in. However, I was frequently picked on and, I believe, frequently said stupid things to people”.</p><h2>Height and Weight</h2><p>Scott Clifton is a gorgeous man standing at a perfect 5 ft 10 in or 1.8 m in height.
