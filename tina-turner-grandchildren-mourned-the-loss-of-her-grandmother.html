Turner‚Äôs career in the music industry was nothing short of iconic, and her family life was equally heartwarming as a mother and grandmother.</p><p>However, <a href=#>Tina Turner son</a> tied the knot with Afida Turner, a French-American singer, and they were blessed with two children, who were Tina Turner grandchildren.</p><p>Tina had two biological children, Craig and Ronald, and she also

Ike had accused Tina of being a bad mother to Ronnie, but she had provided him with everything a child could ask for, including private schools and allowances.</p><p>Sadly, at the age of 62, Ronnie surrendered to complications arising from metastatic colon carcinoma in December 2022 and passed away. Sadly, after almost four months, Tina Turner also left this world to be reunited with his son.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The iconic American singer Tina Turner passed away at the age of 83</h2><p>Tina Turner, the iconic rock and soul singer known for her incredible journey from a modest background and success over a highly abusive marriage, has passed away at the age of 83, as confirmed by her family‚Äôs statement.</p><p>After a long illness, she peacefully passed away on Wednesday, May 24, 2023, at her house in K√ºsnacht, located near Zurich, Switzerland.</p><p>Tine Turner death news was first shared by her family through her official <a href=#>Instagram</a> account.</p><p>One of Tina Turner grandchildren, Tiffany Turner, also shared a story on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> account.
