Tokyo grew up listening to Toni Braxton, Mary J. Blige and Boyz II Men, and became a poet while still in elementary school. Once she reached high school, she transitioned to Biggie, Tupac, and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, and steadily began working on her own rap songs. However, she became a troublemaker, and eventually dropped out of high school to focus on other things in her life – she still hasn’t matriculated from high school, and it doesn’t appear that she is planning to.</p><h2><span id=Career_of_a_rapper>Career of a rapper</span></h2><p>Tokyo launched her career of a rapper while she was still in high school – her first song while she was in her junior year, and it made her somewhat popular in her city. She launched her Instagram and Twitter accounts, and was steadily building her fanbase, mostly using the internet to advertise her music.</p><p>She went on to launch her <a rel=nofollow href=#>YouTube channel</a> on 18 August 2011, and there are currently more than 150,000 people subscribed to it, while it also counts over 32 million views of all her videos combined – Tokyo only uploads her music videos onto the channel, which helped her attract a large crowd, and become popular around the US rather than only in her hometown.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FullSizeRender.jpg></p><p>Her version of the Yo Gotti’s song “Down In The DM” was praised by her fans and went viral on the internet, as it was shared on numerous social media networks, and helped her sign a contract with T. I. She moved to Atlanta from Florida, believing that it would offer more opportunities for her career, and she released her first full-length album entitled “Viral” in 2017 – her most popular single so far is entitled “No Problem”, as it counts more than 2.5 million views on YouTube.</p><h2><span id=The_most_popular_female_rappers_in_the_world>The most popular female rappers in the world</span></h2><p>While female rappers were not that popular in the past, they have risen to prominence today, and some are said to be better than most male rappers.
