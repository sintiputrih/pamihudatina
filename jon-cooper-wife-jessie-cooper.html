Interestingly, the couple met on a blind date. However, it is not known which year they had their first encounter. The former collegiate athlete proposed to his then-girlfriend at sunset on a dock on Lake Mitchell in Cadillac, Michigan, which was owned by Jessie’s family.</p><p>Furthermore, Jon, whom his spouse calls “a romantic,” proposed with a bottle of champagne, and as per her, he used really inspiring words. When the duo was dating, they enjoyed nights on the town and golfing trips. Moreover, once the smitten pair even watched fireworks on a pontoon on July 4.</p><p>Jon and Jessie walked down the aisle in 2005. It has been several years since the pair have been enjoying conjugal bliss.

The lovely duo has welcomed <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>three kids</a> in all these years of being a husband and wife. Jon Cooper’s twin daughters, <strong>Julia Cooper</strong> and <strong>Josie Cooper,</strong> were born in 2008. Likewise, the couple welcomed their son <strong>Jonny Cooper</strong> in 2010. The little ones must be growing up having a wonderful time.</p><p>The Cooper family is a hockey family. Jon and Jessie’s son plays on a junior hockey team, the Tampa Bulls. His dad might have trained him.</p><p>Like Jon Cooper’s partner, his kids also support his career. They often attend his team’s games. However, in September 2020, they all had to cheer on his team nearly 3,000 miles away. Jessie and her children sat down in an interview before Game 3 and talked about what it is like to be emotionally close yet physically far from all the Stanley Cup action.</p><p>Even when they could not watch the match live, the Cooper family watched the game together. Likewise, Jessie allows the three of them to stay up past their bedtime to watch the entire game. Furthermore, the family relied on technology to stay connected during the pandemic.</p><p>In September 2021, the blond beauty and the kids were able to watch Stanley Cup. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Speaking to</a> <strong>Kelly Ring</strong> of FOX 13, she revealed that they were very grateful. She also stated that she was proud of the team.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Know More About Dave Hakstol’s Wife And Children</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Of_Two_Children_Of_Her_Parents></span>One Of Two Children Of Her Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jon Cooper’s wife, Jessie Cooper, previously known as <strong>Jessica Ann Novak</strong>, hails from Cadillac, Michigan.

Likewise, her late dad worked for over four decades in construction. Prior to his death, he completed the construction of the Muskegon Farmers Market. On the other hand, Jessie’s mom, who graduated from Central Michigan University, owned Potentia and worked at Big Rapids Public Schools.</p><p>Nonetheless, Jessie and her sister must have grown up comfortably. They must share a close-knit bond.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jon_Coopers_Wife_Is_An_Attorney></span>Jon Cooper’s Wife Is An Attorney<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Michigan native attended different law schools. She went to Michigan State’s College of Law. Later, she attended Michigan State University and Syracuse University.

In an interview, she reminisced about the time when her hubby got his first full-time job as a coach at Texarkana, Texas.</p><p>Jon Cooper’s spouse added that he was building a small team in a non-hockey market. He had to work hard to build the fan base and sell tickets. In Mrs. Cooper’s opinion, it was not glamorous. But on the other hand, her job was glamorous, and she was making more money than him. She further stated that she was the one keeping them afloat. Later, Jessie had to move again.</p><p>Despite the hardships, the lovebirds have always stayed together, and Jessie even credited their communication as the major reason behind their successful marriage. Moreover, the couple currently resides in Tampa, Florida, so she must be working there. Nonetheless, she must have earned considerably from her career as an attorney.</p><p>All in all, Jon and Jessie are happily married and enjoying their family time with the kids. Let’s hope Jon Cooper’s wife has successful days ahead.</p><p><strong>For<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebritymirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLbOp2Scp5%2BlsrN51qKdnmWamsC0tcRmmqinoJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./malcolm-glazer.html>&#171;&nbsp;Malcolm Glazer</a>
