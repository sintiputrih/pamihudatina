For example, the stars of <strong><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a></strong>: Before the 90 Days, Caleb Greenwood and Alina Kozhevnikova, broke up. The two met 13 years ago after Alina sent Caleb a message saying she wanted to practice her English. Back then, they were both 15 years old. Some years later, they lost touch but found each other again on Tinder. Seeing it as a sign, <a href=#>Alina and Caleb decided to get into a romantic relationship</a>. However, there's been a lot of drama between them since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, TLC fired Alina Kozhevnikova after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she made a bunch of unbelievably offensive social media posts</a>. Due to this, fans never even got to find out the real ending between Alina and Caleb. The pair broke up, and it even looks like they completely cut off all ties at this point. They might not even be friends. From the beginning, Caleb had problems with Alina's height, but this wasn't the only reason behind their split. Here is everything about Alina Kozhevnikova and Caleb Greenwood's complicated relationship.</p><h2 id=why-did-caleb-greenwood-and-alina-kozhevnikova-break-up>Why Did Caleb Greenwood And Alina Kozhevnikova Break Up?</h2><p>From the start, the couple knew that Alina's disability would someday affect their relationship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alina was born with a diastrophic dysplasia disorder that caused her to be little</a>. Right now, it seems like their storyline has finally come to an end since they decided to go their separate ways. In episode 9 of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, Caleb ended their relationship because of their height difference. This came after several racist posts were found on Alina's social media pages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Does '90 Day Fiance' Pay Its Stars?</a></span></p><p>Fans can easily recall when Caleb failed to book an accessible hotel for Alina. He also commented on her height when they met for the first time. At that exact moment, the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days' viewers saw that there would be trouble sooner or later. However, Caleb wasn't the only one who made mistakes in their relationship. There was a time Alina showcased her pushy behavior when she kept asking Caleb for s*x. In addition to that, she also wanted them to be official before he went back to the United States.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-caleb-greenwood-attracted-to-alina-kozhevnikova>Is Caleb Greenwood Attracted To Alina Kozhevnikova?</h2><p>In one episode, viewers saw Caleb telling Alina that he needed time because it was new to him. Moreover, he went on to add that he really liked her though he wasn't used to dating little women. Caleb explained to Alina that he was used to living like a bachelor and that living together with her would be a challenge. While they were saying their goodbyes at the Turkey airport, Caleb asked Alina to stay in touch and that he'd do the same. Nevertheless, a lot changed after Alina and Caleb's time on the show was over. One of the changes was that Alina ended up losing her job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=caleb-greenwood-has-unfollowed-alina-kozhevnikova-on-instagram>Caleb Greenwood Has Unfollowed Alina Kozhevnikova On Instagram</h2><p>The couple would tag each other in their posts for some time, but that eventually stopped. Currently, Caleb seems to have unfollowed Alina on social media. TV shows fans are very good online stalkers, and so far, they have discovered Alina's pictures are still in Caleb's feed. Moreover, they also noticed that Caleb stopped liking and commenting on Alina's posts. Some time ago, one of Alina's followers asked her why Caleb was no longer commenting on her posts. She, later on, replied with "why?" and tagged him. However, Caleb never responded.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Everyone On ‘90 Day Fiance: The Single Life’ And Their Net Worths</a></span></p><p>After one of Alina's racist posts resurfaced, Caleb wrote that he did not condone any kind of prejudice or racism in his story. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perhaps that may be the reason why Caleb slowly lost interest in her</a>. Recently, a Reddit user posted that their girlfriend had a mutual friend who went on a date with Caleb years ago. Caleb reached out to her in November 2021, hoping to hang out. So far, fans can see that he is already working on moving on from his previous relationship; that's if the rumors appear to be true. According to a recent article by InTouchWeekly, the pair may still be somewhat friendly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-alina-kozhevnikova-no-longer-on-39-90-day-fianc-eacute-39>Why Is Alina Kozhevnikova No Longer On '90 Day Fiancé'?</h2><p><a href=#>Like Ella Johnson and Johnny Chao, some couples on the show are stirring up controversy and excitement amongst fans</a>. However, Alina has become well-known for many reasons, not only her polemic posts. Alina Kozhevnikova made history as the first little person to star in the 90 Day franchise. She became an inspirational figure by never letting her limitations stop her from chasing her dreams and finding love.</p><p>While the TLC star started as a fan favorite because of her go-getter attitude and candidness about her disability, things quickly went south for the aspiring model with her behavior on the show and her numerous disparaging remarks about the Asian and black communities over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These Are The Most Controversial '90 Day Fiance' Couples Ever</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmK6tscFmnqudlaPEsLvDZpinnF2Wuaq6wGaiqLKYmsOvtcqorZqrXZe%2FsLfErqdmcWBisaLFjJ%2BgmqaTmnqkrdKtZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./miraculous-live-action-96431.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fan Casting Nora Harriet as Manon in Miraculous (Live Action) on myCast</a>
