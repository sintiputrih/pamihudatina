That’s right, friends: This week’s Project Runway adventure is the client challenge, and this season’s clients are the cast of fellow Bravo property Below Deck. As Christian explains during a brief field trip to Greenpoint Pier, the task before the designers in episode 9, “Below Decked Out,” is to update, elevate, and modernize the crew’s signature yacht uniforms. The two-day challenge will, in theory, give the remaining competitors plenty of time to dream up a beautiful look—so long as it maintains a black-and-white color scheme and features the all-important pair of epaulettes. We mustn’t forget these people work on a boat!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">After blowing their $400 at Mood, the designers skedaddle to the workroom, where the client-designer relationships are smooth ~sailing~ until Captain Sandy (and of course it’s Captain Sandy) asks Prajje for some “bling.” The grim stare he tosses the confessional camera deserves its own fancam edit. Still, he’s a professional! He can make this work! He opts for a black-and-white asymmetrical print and prays it’ll fulfill Sandy’s need to sparkle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Meanwhile, Kara Saun crafts a tuxedo-tracksuit hybrid (for which the PR producers design a helpful dictionary graphic, complete with the phonetic spelling for “tracxedo”); Christian frets over the “big decision” of Anna’s kimono jumpsuit; and Brittany stresses over her male model, her brain playing flashbacks of the menswear suit that nearly got her booted from season 18. All this stress culminates in the night’s happy hour, during which the Project Runway and Below Deck casts celebrate at a bar together. This seems intended as good, innocent stress relief, at least until Gary cozies up to Anna. He pulls her outside to flirt in more intimate proximity, calling her “so cute” (barf) before leaning in to kiss her cheek. This woman is married, Gary! Anna downs a few more tequila shots and bounces her way around the bar, giggling all the way, though she later clarifies to the confessional, “No crush on Gary. No drama. No. I love my husband ’til death.” Sorry, then what was all that about? Producers? Anyone?!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Anyway, Anna escapes without a hangover—or any further dalliance with Gary—and launches into the flurry of activity that is runway morning. This week’s guest judges are Below Deck alumna Kate Chastain and Real Housewives of New York royalty Luann de Lesseps, both of whom know the Bravo game well. As for this week’s looks, let’s dig in:</p><ul data-node-id=6 class="css-yzf9pi et3p2gv0"><li><strong>Bishme:</strong> Yachtie Aesha looks fantastic in what feels like a genuinely modernized version of the Below Deck uniform. Unlike many of the other runway looks in this week’s episode, Bishme’s striped mini skirt and quarter-zip collared shirt maintained the classic nautical look while boosting it—particularly with his choice of neoprene fabric. Aesha’s outfit is something I could actually envision implemented on BD.</li><li><strong>Laurence: </strong>As per usual, Laurence’s leather creation is stunning. Chief Resident Flirt Gary looks confident—if a bit goofy, though I think that’s just his overall effect—in the well-cut jacket, and the jumpsuit underneath is an appropriate take on quintessential workwear. I don’t think this is the most artistically impressive design of the night, but it fits the assignment.</li><li><strong>Korto:</strong> From a creative perspective, I appreciate the movement of Korto’s loose vest layered over a chartreuse-striped romper. (And I love the fit of the romper itself.) But I’m skeptical about that vest’s functionality. If you’re working in a windy environment (i.e. a boat), wouldn’t you want fabric that doesn’t flap about, snagging on doorknobs and knocking over glasses of champagne? Maybe I’m just not cut out for life on a yacht—shocking, I know—but there’s no way I could get away with wearing that vest as a steward.</li><li><strong>Kara Saun:</strong> I’m afraid deckhand Mzi is going to be sweating profusely in Kara Saun’s tracxedo, especially given its 1) cut in a light-absorbent black fabric and b) layered over a shirt and trousers. As Christian might put it, it’s “a lot of look,” particularly given the gold stripe details along the arms, the sparkle embellishments, the utility belt, and the sunglasses. Mzi looks like he’s having a fabulous time showing off Kara Saun’s creativity, but I’m not sure how he’d feel if he actually had to wear this ensemble to work.</li><li><strong>Rami:</strong> He’s back, baby!! Rami had redemption on the brain this episode, and his design is proof he deserved the Siriano Save: The tennis-inspired mini skirt and poncho-like cut of his jacket are fashion-forward but intelligently designed for the elements (and encounters) of yacht life. The poncho unzips to reveal an elegant short-sleeve top made of perforated fabric—again, another functional but stylish piece. This might be my favorite look of the night.</li><li><strong>Brittany:</strong> I’m so pleased to see Brittany broke her menswear curse with this modern, utilitarian jumpsuit that features her signature top-stitching. I could see this piece selling out fast, especially if she were to make men’s, women’s and gender-neutral versions.</li><li><strong>Anna: </strong>I like Captain Jason’s kimono-inspired jumpsuit a lot more than I thought it would, particularly because its details are noticeable enough to register but subtle enough not to overpower. Still, I’m not sure the design reads “captain’s uniform,” nor do I think the judges will align with Anna’s vision.</li><li><strong>Prajje:</strong> Let’s make one thing clear: I think Prajje is an absolute master at his particular aesthetic. But even he seems hesitant about the look he put on Captain Sandy this episode. The asymmetrical print is outdated, the silhouette is far too simple, and the peplum ruffles are unnecessary. I think Prajje knows he can put out better work than this, and I hope it doesn’t get him kicked off.</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">After Nina ensures that Rami’s look “passes the twerk test”—a moment I’ll need to watch at least five more times to finish processing—the judges determine their rankings: Rami, Brittany, and Bishme are in the top, with Kara Saun, Anna, and Prajje in the bottom. These are the right picks, as far as I’m concerned, and Bishme finally gets his well-deserved win. It’s about time, y’all! The man’s been waiting!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">And so it’s Anna who, after an objectively weird week, is forced to go home. I don’t think her look was the worst this episode, so I was surprised to watch the judges axe her anyway. But losing Prajje would’ve been unthinkable, and Kara Saun has also proven her mettle in multiple recent challenges. Maybe saying goodbye to Anna was a necessary evil, but I’ll miss the drama—whether intended or not—she’s sprinkled like fairy dust into season 20. At least now she can get back to her family, and (thankfully) away from Gary.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Next week is a Project Runway first: The designers get free rein to create whatever they want. I hope they know we’re expecting chaos.</p><h6 class="css-e6lzgm e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Read last episode’s recap</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51ksLa4066pnmedpMOqsdJmq69nkWmBeH6WaW5uZ6CnvKuxwq1kq62erK66edKemKynnmJ%2FcXnEqaCsp5Saenp50Z6amqhdl7Ktu9Zmm56bm5qxbrvUrWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./all-returning-indiana-jones-characters-in-dial-of-destiny.html>&#171;&nbsp;All returning Indiana Jones characters in Dial of Destiny</a>
