Yet, even in this generation, wrestlers needed to have the ability to cut a promo. While many performers reached the main event with physical charisma and in ring style, they could have climbed to greater heights if they could have improved their promo skills. <a href=#>The New Generation Era</a> was full of some silver tongue virtuosos, such as The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and James Cornette. While other stars lacked their verbal ability. This is the story of some of the worst talkers in WWE's New Generation.</p><h2 id=ahmed-johnson><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ahmed Johnson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ahmed-Johnson-Vince-McMahon.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ahmed Johnson took the WWE New Generation Era by storm. The Pearl River Powerhouse looked like the proverbial million bucks. His move set was powerful and impressive looking. His in ring physical charisma captured the audience. Ahmed Johnson would become one of the best<a href=#> Intercontinental Champions of the New Generation Era</a>. Yet, Johnson's promos were horrible. Johnson combined screaming with mumbling with the ability to be incoherent. Ahmed Johnson had a meteoric rise in WWE, but his gift (lack of) gab most definitely held the powerful talent back.</p><h2 id=head-shrinkers><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Head Shrinkers</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Headshrinkers.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Head Shrinkers are former WWE tag team champions. The team of Samu and Fatu continued the Samoan legacy in WWC during the New Generation Era. The Shrinkers always had a manager. As heels, they were managed by Wild Samoan, Afa (Samu's father). As a face team, they were managed by the <a href=#>legendary Captain Lou Albano.</a> No matter which version appeared in promos, the Head Shrinkers portrayed wild savages that couldn't speak English. During promos, they would just yell unidentifiable words and allow their manager to speak for them. Fatu would show the gift of gab later on in his career as be transitioned into Rikishi.</p><h2 id=bastion-booger><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bastion Booger</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bastion-booger2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bastion Booger's gimmick was known for being gross. That was it, just a large gross human being. This New Generation Era gimmick would be a strike out for WWE. Booger's greatest accomplishment in WWE, was winning a Slammy Award for being "Most Likely To See Jenny Craig". <a href=#>Bastion Booger</a> had no chance with his character, and less of a chance when he cut a promo. Booger's promos consisted of him yelling and pointing and talking about food. Booger was once invited to the WWE RAW announce team, where Booger discussed barbecuing Punxsutawney Phil, fart jokes and the lack of free food in catering.</p><h2 id=marty-jannetty><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Marty Jannetty</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Marty-Jannetty-Barber-Shop-Cropped.jpg><p>Marty Jannetty is a fomer World Tag Team and Intercontinental Champion in WWE. As a member of the Rockers, Jannetty would infamously be thrown through a barber shop window by partner Shawn Michaels. While the heel turn would send HBK's career through the roof, Jannetty still had his in ring moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things WWE Fans Should Know About Marty Jannetty</a></span></p><p>Most of Jannetty's glass ceiling consisted of his own personal demons, yet his promos most definetly held the tag team expert back. Jannetty would trip over his own words, and always wanted to sound cooler than he really was. After Shawn Michaels successfully turned Heart Break Kid into HBK, Jannetty started to refer to himself as MJ.</p><h2 id=adam-bomb><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Adam Bomb</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adam-bomb.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adam Bomb stood 6'6 and weighed almost 300 pounds. He looked the part of a WWE superstar. He could walk the walk in the ring, but he struggled with talking the talk. Adam Bomb would be given two different managers during his short stint in the New Generation to help get the powerhouse over. First, he would debut with Johnny Polo and a few months later switch to the <a href=#>very unlikable Harvey Whippleman</a>. Neither manager could make up for Bomb's lack of verbal charisma. In promos, his managers would talk the majority to the allotted time, and Bomb would complete one very rehearsed line at the end to drive home his point.</p><h2 id=mr-fuji><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mr. Fuji</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/yokozuna-camp-cornette.jpg><p>Mr Fuji is a WWE Hall of Famer and former tag team champion. His career runs through the Golden Era and the New Generation Era of WWE. In both generations, Fuji, was a very poor talker.

Sid would become a major professional wrestling superstar despite his poor ability to cut a coherent promo. Sid famously misspoke saying he "had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">half the brain that you do</a>" to Kevin Nash. Leading up to a Golden Age Era WrestleMania main event with Hulk Hogan, he would tell Hogan that he knew Hulk "was feared of him". Sid's misspoken promos, maniac laughter, inaudible speaking and decibel piercing screams were all a part of his talking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lex-luger><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lex Luger</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lex-Luger-v-Jason-Knight-Raw-February-1-1993-Cropped.jpg><p>Lex Luger was chiseled from stone and looked like a Greek god in a WWE ring. Many experts predicted that Lex Luger would become the next Hulk Hogan during the WWE New Generation Era. The former professional football player was an explosive athlete with a superhero physique dripping of main steam media potential. Yet, Lex Luger never won a title in his WWE career. His greatest accomplishment was tying at the Royal Rumble with Bret Hart. What held the Total Package back? His ability to connect with the mic. For the most part, Luger could cut a coherent promo, yet his words always lacked realism. Luger always sounded like a staged rehearsed promo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bret-hart><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Bret Hart</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bret-Hart-Attitude-Promo-Cropped.jpg><p>Bret Hart is a seven time World Champion and a WWE Hall of Famer. He was the lead face of the New Generation Era. What more could a fan ask for? As a babyface, Hart always come across upset in his promos. The <a href=#>leader of the New Generation Era</a> sounded most grumpy as a face. As the Excellence of Execution, Hart's career was extraordinary, but his promos as a face were lace than ordinary. As one of the most recognizable champions in the 1990s, Hart tried to parlay that fame into a Hollywood career. Yet, that career never took off, most likely due to his lack of charisma in verbal communication. In the WWE Attitude Era, Hart would find his gift of gab as a straight shooting heel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=british-bulldog><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>British Bulldog</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/British-Bulldog-European-Champion-Cropped.jpg><p>The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith's career is full of WWE accolades. Smith is a former 2 time Tag Team Champion, 2 time European Champion, 2 time Hardcore Champion and an Intercontinental Champion in WWE. In 2020, Smith was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Yet, Smith was an absolute terrible promo, no matter if he was a heel or a face. The Bulldog's thick British accent, did not help his delivery. Ultimately, Smith struggled to remember lines and when he recited them they sounded horribly rehearsed. While Smith achievements are legendary, with a better promo skill, <a href=#>he could have been a World Champion</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenpL%2B0wIytmKWjlafAbsPWnmSnnaditKa6xKuYraGfo3qmvsBo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chad-w-murray-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chad W.
