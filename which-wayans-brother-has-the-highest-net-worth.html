For example, it is nearly impossible to think about the music world without the contributions of the Jonas Brothers, the Jacksons, the Judds, and the Gallaghers among many others. While it is wonderful that families like that rose to fame together, it is nearly impossible to not compare them to one another. For example, there is a lot of interest in <a href=#>whether Joe or Nick Jonas has a higher net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of the comedy world, one of the most influential families of all time is the Wayans. After all, the Wayans starred in several hit projects by themselves or in various combinations and In Living Color is legendary in large part because they were all so great together. Given the importance of the Wayans family’s legacy, it makes sense that so many people continue to care about them and compare them to one another. For example, the most obvious thing to wonder is which of the Wayans brothers has the highest net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things The Jonas Brothers Did Since Their Disney Channel Days</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-other-wayans>The Other Wayans</h2><p>Even though there is no doubt that the four Wayans brothers all deserve to be considered comedy legends, they aren’t the only successful members of the family. For example, just like his father before him, Damon Wayans Jr. has enjoyed a lot of success in the comedy world. Best known for his roles in shows like New Girl and Happy Endings, Wayans Jr. also was a memorable part of the movies Let’s Be Cops and Big Hero 6. As a result of all that work, he is a big enough star that <a href=#>Netflix</a> was excited to <a href=#>announce a movie they made with Wayans Jr.</a> and he has amassed a $9 million net worth.</p><p>While it is awesome that the Wayans brothers are roundly respected, it is a shame that the sole Wayans sister doesn’t get enough praise. After all, Kim Wayans was a valuable member of In Living Color’s cast, she was a major part of the series In the House, and she has popped up in a long list of other shows and movies. Fortunately for Kim, her career has made her very comfortable as she has an $8 million fortune as of this writing, according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Fans Actually Want A ‘Big Hero 7’?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-brothers-rsquo-fortunes>The Brothers’ Fortunes</h2><p>Of all the famous Wayans brothers, Shawn Wayans is the youngest by just a year. After first being introduced to the world as In Living Color’s musical act, Shawn was originally known as DJ SW1. Once Shawn was added to In Living Color’s actual cast, fans quickly realized how funny he can be. In the years that followed, Shawn’s tenure as one of the stars of TV’s The Wayans Bros. turned him into a sitcom star. On top of that, Shawn went on to star in movies like Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2, Little Man, and White Chicks. All of those jobs allowed Shawn to accumulate a $30 million net worth as of this writing, according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Long Did It Take The Wayans Brothers' To Put On Makeup In 'White Chicks'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there can be a lot of debate about which Wayans brother is the most famous, there is a strong argument for Damon Wayans. After all, Damon starred in a long list of movies including The Last Boy Scout, Blankman, Major Payne, and Bulletproof among others. More recently, Damon starred in several shows including In Living Color, Damon, My Wife and Kids, as well as Lethal Weapon. Given all of his credits, it actually is surprising that <a href=#>Damon is only worth $35 million</a> as of this writing, according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout their careers, all of the Wayans brothers have been closely associated with one another in the minds of their fans. However, there is no doubt that two of the siblings have worked together by far the most, Shawn and Marlon. In fact, Marlon starred in all of the projects that were listed as a part of Shawn’s career above. However, Marlon has also played a major role in a lot of other notable projects including movies like The 6th Man, Requiem for a Dream, The Ladykillers, and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra among others. As a result, his net worth is larger than Shawns since <a href=#>Marlon has a $40 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p>Despite the obvious comedic skills that the famous Wayans all possess, it is still incredible that they all became big stars. However, it isn’t a coincidence as Keenen Ivory Wayans is the person who paved the way to all of their successes. After co-writing the hit movies Hollywood Shuffle and I’m Gonna Git You Sucka, the latter of which he also directed, Fox approached Keenen and offered him his own show. Instead of solely focusing on his own success, Keenen created In Living Color, the show that launched the careers of all his famous siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After In Living Color became a huge hit with Keenen Ivory Wayans serving as the show’s writer in addition to his onscreen role in its success, he gained a lot of clout in the business. For that reason, Keenen went on to get a lot of work both onscreen and behind the camera. While there isn’t enough room to list Kennen’s credits here, it makes sense that he is the wealthiest Wayans family member. After all, according to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kennen is worth $65 million</a> as of this writing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Which Wayans Brother Is The Most Successful?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXq4rdiapaxlkqe8tbTEq2ShmaNiwamxjKGgoKCVqMFuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./10-movies-like-crazy-stupid-love.html>&#171;&nbsp;12 movies like Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>
