<i>Argo</i> <a href=#>trailer</a>: “If I’m gonna make a fake movie, I’m gonna make a fake hit!” As an old-school Hollywood producer, Lester Siegel, enlisted to pretend to make a sci-fi movie that needs to be shot in Iran in order to help the CIA sneak six American embassy workers out of the country during the hostage crisis, the 78-year-old is the anchor and heart of the most absurd part of an incredibly hard-to-believe true story. And in a huge ensemble (mostly in amazing late-seventies wigs and mustaches), his is the one role showy enough to be meriting Oscar talk — while Ben Affleck is rightly getting major attention for his directing. Vulture spoke to Arkin, who lives in Santa Fe, by phone about bad movies, Affleck, and Canadians. Picture him saying everything with long, gravely pauses, bemusement, and a Brooklyn accent.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e6c86331eaad7518055ce68bb0941977-3-0-0@published data-word-count=84><b>Is your character based on a real person?</b><br>Well, when I was making the movie I thought it was, and I did some research on him and found that what was written in the script had very little to do with what I was reading about the character, who was real. And then I found out after the film that he was actually based on a composite of two or three different people, which would have been hard to play. It’s hard to play composites.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e6c86331eaad7518055ce68bb0941977-4-0-0@published data-word-count=49><b>So, there is no Lester Siegel?</b><br>Well, there was a Lester Siegel. There was a real producer named Lester Siegel, and he apparently did some work with the OSS in World War II, and he’s a lot of what the guy’s based on, but there were other people thrown in.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e6c86331eaad7518055ce68bb0941977-5-0-0@published data-word-count=50><b>You did this research after you shot the movie, so in your head, were you basing the character on producers you’d met in real life?</b><br>Yeah, I was basing him on [Warner Bros. founder] <a href=#>Jack Warner</a>, who I met briefly at a party once in Hollywood a long, long time ago.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e6c86331eaad7518055ce68bb0941977-6-0-0@published data-word-count=11><b>What was it about Jack that fit?</b><br>His extraordinary confidence and brashness.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e6c86331eaad7518055ce68bb0941977-7-0-0@published data-word-count=90><b>What was it like meeting him at the party?</b><br>Well, it was a party, I think, for Wait Until Dark. A lot of people and this little man — he looked like he was about three-feet-one — came over to me with a big smile on his face, and he says, “Hi! I’m the man that owns this building.” And I said, “Oh,” and that was about it. He just went on for about five minutes exalting in his ownership of his studio, very affable and aggressive and comfortable with himself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e6c86331eaad7518055ce68bb0941977-8-0-0@published data-word-count=15><b>All while being three-feet-one.</b><br>Well, no, he was bigger than that.

I think he’s a major American director. And I love the fact that [the movie] changes tone throughout in three different ways, from the Hollywood stuff to the Washington stuff to the Iranian stuff, but still retaining the integrity of the main story.
