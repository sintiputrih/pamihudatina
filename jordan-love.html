He attended Utah State for his college football career before being selected by the Packers in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draught.</p><p>On November 2, 1998, Love was conceived in Bakersfield, California. Love lost his father, Orbin Jr., when he was just 14 years old. Love studied at Liberty High. By his senior year, he had been chosen the starter after being informed as a freshman that he could not play quarterback. Love rushed for 806 yards and eight touchdowns as a senior while also passing for 2,148 yards and 24 scores. A 2-star recruit, he chose Utah State over offers from Eastern Washington, Northern Arizona, Northern Colorado, and Sacramento State to play college football.</p><p>Over three seasons at Utah State, Love made 22 starts. He completed 8,507 passes for 60 touchdowns and 17 interceptions for 8,507 yards. He ran for 1,903 yards and 20 touchdowns as well. Love received the Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year award in 2018.</p><p>With the 26th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draught, the Packers selected Love. During his first season, he was seated behind Aaron Rodgers, but in Week 17’s game against the Detroit Lions, he made his NFL debut. In the Packers’ 37-30 victory, Love completed 17 of 27 passes for 134 yards and a touchdown.</p><p>A gifted quarterback with a powerful arm and good movement, Love. Although his passing skills need work, he has everything it takes to become great in the NFL. For the foreseeable future, he will be Rodgers’ backup, but he might someday replace Rodgers as the starting quarterback for the Packers.</p><p><strong>Here are some additional facts about Jordan Love:</strong></p><ul><li>He is 6’4″ and 219 pounds.</li><li>He wears jersey number 10 for the Packers.</li><li>His favorite NFL team growing up was the Denver Broncos.</li><li>He is a big fan of Tom Brady.</li><li>He is engaged to Breanna Butler.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jordan_Love_Career></span><strong>Jordan Love Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jordan Love has only played one season in the NFL so far, but he has already shown flashes of potential. He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft with the 26th overall pick. He sat behind Aaron Rodgers for his rookie season, but he made his NFL debut in Week 17 against the Detroit Lions. Love completed 17 of 27 passes for 134 yards and a touchdown in the Packers’ 37-30 win.</p><p>In 2021, Love again served as Rodgers’ backup. He played in two games, completing 12 of 20 passes for 131 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 50 yards.</p><p>Love is a talented quarterback with a strong arm and good mobility. He is still developing as a passer, but he has the potential to be a star in the NFL. He will be waiting in the wings for Rodgers for the foreseeable future, but he could eventually take over as the Packers’ starting quarterback.</p><p><strong>Here is a summary of Jordan Love’s NFL career statistics:</strong></p><ul><li>Games played: 3</li><li>Pass attempts: 39</li><li>Completions: 29</li><li>Completion percentage: 74.4%</li><li>Passing yards: 365</li><li>Passing touchdowns: 2</li><li>Passing interceptions: 0</li><li>Rushing yards: 50</li><li>Rushing touchdowns: 0</li></ul><p>Love is still a young player, but he has the potential to be a great quarterback in the NFL. He has the physical tools and the mental makeup to be successful. He just needs to continue to develop his skills and learn from Aaron Rodgers. If he can do that, he could be the Packers’ starting quarterback for many years to come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jordan_Love_Stats_Drafts_Age_Net_Worth></span><strong>Jordan Love Stats, Drafts, Age, Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Here are some stats, drafts, age, and net worth of Jordan Love:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Stats:</strong><ul><li>Games played: 3</li><li>Pass attempts: 39</li><li>Completions: 29</li><li>Completion percentage: 74.4%</li><li>Passing yards: 365</li><li>Passing touchdowns: 2</li><li>Passing interceptions: 0</li><li>Rushing yards: 50</li><li>Rushing touchdowns: 0</li></ul></li><li><strong>Drafts:</strong><ul><li>2020 NFL Draft: Round 1, Pick 26 by the Green Bay Packers</li></ul></li><li><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;24 (born November 2, 1998)</li><li><strong>Net worth:</strong>&nbsp;$3 million (estimated)</li></ul><p>Love is a young quarterback with a lot of potential.

He almost missed completing a long pass to Christian Watson, which would have been his greatest completion of the day, but he concluded the night with a touchdown.</p><p>Love remarked, “I think we played well,” following the game. “The passing game moved very smoothly. Of course, Christian, the safety, made a great play on the one that went down the sideline. In addition, I believe that both of my series ended with a touchdown, so I was pleased with that, and moving ahead, I thought we played pretty well.</p><p>Matt LaFleur, the head coach, concurred with what he witnessed.</p><p>“There’s a lot to learn from it, and a lot of good came out of it,” LaFleur added. We were moving in and out of the huddle quickly, so I felt like it was a pretty excellent first exposure for him this season because of the calm and command he shown.</p><p>Love appears confident in himself and his coach appears confident in him as he enters his first season as the Packers’ starter.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Charlie Hurt Bio, Wikipedia, Wiki, Family, Twitter, Wife, Net Worth, Height, Salary</a></li><li><a href=#>Morgan Evans Girlfriend, Wikipedia, Wiki, Who Is, Dating, Net Worth, Age</a></li><li><a href=#>Oliver Anthony Wikipedia, Wiki, Music, Singer, Age, Instagram</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtoop%2BnsaK6jKWmr51f</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nia-long-husband-net-worth-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nia Long Husband Net Worth 2024</a>
