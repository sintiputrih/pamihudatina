They were the talk of the town during the height of the vampire-inspired film phenomena. Fans couldn’t get enough of the duo’s on-screen romance, and rumors of a real-life romance began to swirl and bombarded them with so many questions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the Edward Cullen actor always denied the rumors, insisting that he and his co-star Stewart were only just friends. He even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called the idea of dating her “ridiculous.”</a> Yet, many fans and media outlets were not convinced, as the two of them had undeniable chemistry both on and off-screen. So, why did Pattinson lie when asked about the dating rumors?</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson-once-denied-dating-kirsten-stewart>Robert Pattinson Once Denied Dating Kirsten Stewart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/twilight-behind-the-scenes-robert-pattinson-and-kristen-stewart-29871668-1364-768.jpg><p>Robert Pattinson, the actor known for his role in the Twilight saga, was once asked about the rumors of him dating Kristen Stewart. In an interview back in 2009, he told the news outlet that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and the actress were “just good friends”</a> and that the rumors about their relationship were a joke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pattinson, who found the rumors frustrating, gushed, “It doesn’t make any difference what you say [to the tabloids]. I’ve literally been across the country [from Kristen], and it’s like ‘Oh, they were on secret dates!’ It’s like ‘Where? I can’t get out of my hotel room!’”</p><p>Not only the actor denied the rumors, but his leading lady also found the dating rumors infuriating. The actress, who <a href=#>once revealed she would marry Pattinson</a>, said, “We’re characters in this comic book.”</p><p>But despite his denial, many were not convinced. They pointed to the couple’s body language and their chemistry on and off-screen as evidence that they were more than just friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look At Robert Pattinson And Kristen Stewart’s Friendship Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2019 interview, the actor discussed why he’d rather <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep his romantic relationship so private.</a> He said, “If you let people in, it devalues what love is. If a stranger on the street asked you about your relationship, you’d think it extremely rude. If you put up a wall it ends up better. I can’t understand how someone can walk down the street holding hands, and it’s the same when I do it and a hundred people are taking your photo.”</p><p>He added, “The line between when you’re performing and when you’re not will eventually get washed away and you’ll get completely mad.”</p><p>It seems that Pattinson's denial in 2012 may have been a way to protect his relationship with Stewart. It’s clear that he has learned a lot about privacy and the value of keeping his personal life out of the public eye.</p><p>While he may have denied his romance with Stewart in the past, he now understands the importance of keeping certain things out of the media spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-pattinson-and-kristen-stewart-were-once-warned-against-dating>Robert Pattinson And Kristen Stewart Were Once Warned Against Dating</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5bf59b4a39c7c82c576b9741_Twilight.jpg><p>It could be true that the Twilight film's setting made it difficult not to develop romantic feelings for their co-stars. Pattinson and Stewart faced a similar struggle to their characters Edward and Bella when it came to their own romantic relationship. The couple was strongly <a href=#>advised against getting together</a> due to the potential risks it could pose for the franchise’s future success.</p><p>According to Ashley Greene, who played Alice Cullen in the films, the studio was concerned about the negative impact the relationship could have on the actor’s on-screen chemistry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her words: “They saw how successful Twilight was and the last thing they want is for the couple to get together and then hate each other and then the chemistry to be gone and that’s it. So I kind of get that. But at the same time, you’re put in these situations where it’s an epic love story and it’s difficult not to catch feelings in those situations.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Kristen Stewart Regret Starting A Relationship With Her Ex Robert Pattinson?</a></span></p><p>During the filming of the first Twilight movie, Stewart was in a romantic relationship with Michael Angarano, her co-star in the film, Speak. It wasn’t until shortly before they began filming the second installment of the saga, New Moon, that she and Pattinson began dating. Fans had even given them the couple nickname, “Robsten.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Greene added, “They’re in these really intense situations and as an actor, you find something about that person to fall in love with. So it kind of made sense. But they’re also great actors, so all day every day, they’re supposed to be in love and so it’s not like they had to hide much.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Robert Pattinson And Kristen Stewart Still Talk?</a></span></p><p>In 2013, it was revealed that <a href=#>Stewart had cheated on Pattinson</a> with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders. The scandal rocked Hollywood and brought an end to Pattinson and Stewart's relationship. Pattinson was left heartbroken, and many wondered if he had really known about the affair all along.</p><p>In the end, the couple’s relationship may have been doomed from the start. But one thing is for sure, their on-screen and off-screen chemistry captivated audiences and made them one of Hollywood's most iconic couples.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledGomZ6qpGK9osDToqWsp55iuaqxjJqZqK2kYrGiwMinnmajop7AtbHNZqqtnaeWv7V7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-old-is-kareem-abdul-jabbar-and-why-is-he-in-the-hospital.html>&#171;&nbsp;How old is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and why is he in the hospital?</a>
