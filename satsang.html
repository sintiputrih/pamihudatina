They express a shift from fear of the unknown to a deep sense of belonging in the world. They no longer need validation from anyone else and recognize that their story is valuable and worth telling. They acknowledge that their own path is unique and trust in their ability to learn from their experiences, past and present. The singer rejoices in the sense of community and belonging they feel, even as they continually travel to new places. They feel destined to be there, even if fear still exists within them. They go forward boldly, realizing that they too are a part of the world’s great mysteries.</p><br><p>Throughout the song, Satsang speaks of fear, the unknown, and the importance of shedding that fear in order to grow in one’s journey. The singer declares that they will remain true to themselves and their beliefs, serving as a warrior against evil and allowing the lessons of the spirits to guide them. The song presents a message of hope, that each person is worthy and deserving of love and belonging. The singer declares this not only for themselves but for all people, recognizing the pressures and the obstacles that confront each individual on their own path.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline

harm.</p><br><p><u>A warrior at heart so precaution must be took</u><br>I have a fighting spirit, and I take appropriate measures to protect myself.</p><br><p><u>Trying to give in, to the lessons that will soften, my ways and means are changing cause I talk to spirit often</u><br>I am open to learning lessons that will guide me towards kindness and compassion, and I communicate with my spiritual guides frequently.</p><br><p><u>Tell me to stay sharp, tells me to stay present</u><br>My spiritual guides remind me to stay focused and attentive.</p><br><p><u>Tells me to ignore the fools and focus on accent</u><br>My spiritual guides advise me to disregard negative influences and concentrate on my strengths.</p><br><p><u>I will starve my ego, I will remain strong</u><br>I will minimize my self-centeredness in order to cling to my inner resilience.</p><br><p><u>I will make mistakes and I will often be wrong</u><br>I will make errors and do the wrong thing, but it is all part of my learning process.</p><br><p><u>I'm perfectly imperfect and I'm only here to learn and all the evil on the path gets burned</u><br>I fully understand my flaws and weaknesses, and view my existence as a permanent learning experience wherein negative energy will be destroyed.</p><br><p><u>The pressure always comes from the outside</u><br>External forces frequently bring about stress.</p><br><p><u>Try not to let it in where i reside</u><br>I attempt to prevent these external forces from affecting my personal space.</p><br><p><u>This is my home, my heart, my voice, my love, my life, my path, my voice</u><br>I acknowledge that my home, passions, and expressions form part of my identity.</p><br><p><u>I feel my heart grow with each step</u><br>I perceive a gradual strengthening of my emotions with every stride forward.</p><br><p><u>Stand firm in where the path goes next</u><br>I am confident in the direction my journey will take me, and I stand by this belief unwaveringly.</p><br><p><u>I know that where it goes is where it needs to be, the more lessons rained down more blessings I see</u><br>I have faith that wherever my journey leads will be the right place, and I understand that each challenge brings about new rewards.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Lily E.
