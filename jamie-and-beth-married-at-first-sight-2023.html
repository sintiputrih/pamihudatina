Thompson shared that he has decided to take this step in order to prioritize his personal growth and well-being.</p><p>Thompson and Bice tied the knot in 2019 during the ninth season of “Married at First Sight.” The show’s unique premise involves couples getting married without having met beforehand. Despite encountering some intense arguments during their time on the show, Thompson and Bice chose to stay together once filming concluded. They initially resided in San Francisco before eventually relocating together to Colorado.</p><p>In his Instagram post, Thompson emphasized that his decision to separate was primarily driven by his own need for self-care and personal development. He acknowledged that this process might be challenging but believes it is necessary for him to become the best version of himself. While uncertain about the future of their relationship, Thompson expressed optimism, stating that regardless of the outcome, he will emerge as a stronger individual.</p><p>In his Instagram Story, Thompson provided further insight into their separation, revealing that Bice made the decision to leave after a series of intense fights between them. He admitted to saying regrettable things fueled by anger and frustration. Thompson also mentioned feeling a lack of reciprocal effort from Bice in terms of finding solutions and moving forward. As a result, she has been absent for four weeks, leading Thompson to believe that focusing on his personal growth is currently the best course of action.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-13-at-23.07.39.png><p>The news of their separation may surprise fans, as the couple recently celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary in March. Both Thompson and Bice took to Instagram to share heartfelt messages commemorating the occasion, expressing love and gratitude for each other and the life they have built together.</p><p>Thompson admitted to previously feeling the need to present their marriage in a more positive light than its reality. However, the recent separation has made him realize the importance of being honest about their situation and prioritizing self-care. He acknowledged that separations are not always the ideal solution and that he is actively working on managing his anger and improving his ability to communicate effectively.</p><p>Thompson concluded by stating that their decision to separate was not triggered by a single event but rather a culmination of multiple small issues. He described it as “death by a thousand paper cuts,” indicating that it was the accumulation of these minor problems that led to their current situation. While Thompson openly discussed their separation on social media, Bice has not yet publicly addressed his statements.</p><p>In summary, Jamie Thompson, known from “Married at First Sight,” and his wife, Beth Bice, are currently undergoing a separation as Thompson focuses on personal growth and self-care.
