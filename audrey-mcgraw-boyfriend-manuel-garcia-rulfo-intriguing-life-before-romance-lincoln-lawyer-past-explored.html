"There was no shortage of cast," Manuel recalled to the WSJ. "He had a huge family of eight girls and my father. <strong>Decades later, when I was growing up, he'd screen the short films for me and his 31 other grandkids.&nbsp;</strong>They were wonderful action dramas, usually about cowboys or robberies."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d1c01311ee3-audrey-manuel.jpg><p id=ed4B7V_KQj data-wc=35>He added: "My grandfather's home movies were like Hollywood productions. Instead of shooting 16mm footage of his kids at the table or playing outside, he created stories and scripts and used a professional editing deck."</p><h2>Manuel's battle with dyslexia</h2><p id=ek_5lR0slf data-wc=53>He has been open about his <a class=hm-link href=#>struggles with dyslexia</a> and how he overcame them. Manuel said he created an alternate reality for himself by daydreaming and this led to his passion for acting. Learning his lines was made more difficult because of his dyslexia so he resorted to a method his grandmother used.</p><p id=eh-rSuily6 data-wc=45>"I bought a blackboard and put it in my apartment," he said. <strong>"It was crazy I made mental maps with images, drawings. I did it for every scene.</strong> If there was a gun, I drew a gun. It's easier for me to learn that way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/33808e7036e4-manuel-garcia-rulfo.jpg><h2>Manuel moved to America to learn English</h2><p id=ed6WE4ywnc data-wc=64>English was his second language and to help him learn, his parents sent him to Vermont in the US on an exchange program at the age of 12. "My parents had purposefully chosen a remote town in a small state where there wouldn’t be any Spanish-speaking kids," he explained. "The goal was to put me in a situation where I had to learn English.</p><p id=ekA_LBaeE6Fk data-wc=31><strong>"The family was warm and loving, and their son, Mark, treated me like a brother.&nbsp;</strong>We’re still in touch today. In addition to becoming fluent in English, I learned to ski."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2>His family didn't want him to become an actor</h2><p id=e3bg7DlaTF data-wc=33>Despite the joy that creating the family movies brought, Manuel said his family weren't keen for him to break into the entertainment industry and would have preferred he train to become a dentist.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNTa8xUjgb data-wc=53>"The more serious about acting I became, the more my family asked me to be realistic," Manuel revealed in the article. <strong>"My uncle urged me to study dentistry since the practice was already in place.</strong> My parents said, 'Manuel, we don't know anybody in this industry. How are we going to help you?'"</p><p id=e9dDUrtwkJf data-wc=37>He therefore said he had no choice but to succeed and eventually attended the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles. He pursued acting classes for years in both Mexico and America until he got his break.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cbe692d4162c-tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-audrey-mcgraw.jpg><p id=esvlN3kwo8 data-wc=48>Where else would we have seen him?In 2016, he starred in and he said at that point "doors started opening" for him.
