Besides this, Dan is also widely recognized for being the creator of NBC’s sitcom “Community”, as well as the co-founder of the short film festival and comedy channel – Channel 101.</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dan Harmon</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Wednesday, August 26, 2015</a></p><h2>Dan Harmon’s Early Life and Education</h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Daniel ‘Dan’ Harmon</a> was born under the zodiac sign of Capricorn on the 3rd January 1973, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA, and apart from being of American nationality, is also of white ethnicity. Further details about Dan’s family’s background have never been publicly disclosed to the present day. Upon completing his elementary education, Dan matriculated from Brown Deer High School in his home town, after which he enrolled at Marquette University, and briefly attended Glendale Community College, however, there is no information as to whether he graduated from either of those.</p><h2>Dan Harmon’s Early Career</h2><p>Dan Harmon began his career in the entertainment business in the mid-1990s as a member of the improvisational comedy organization named ComedySportz, based in Milwaukee. Later he joined its ‘splinter group’, a sketch troupe named The Dead Alewives, which was orientated more towards uncensored and improvisational humor; the troupe released the “Take Down the Grand Master” album in 1996. In the course of the next couple of years, Harmon frequented Milwaukee’s club scene, honing his skills, and regularly appearing at the Safehouse free comedy stage, where he rose to fame due to his comedy routine, which included a song about masturbation.</p><p>In 1999, alongside Rob Schrab, Dan co-created a humoristic Sci-Fi TV series pilot episode named “Heat Vision and Jack”, with Jack Black and Owen Wilson in the main roles and Ben Stiller as its director. Despite not becoming a TV series, the video became a critically acclaimed cult classic itself, so encouraged by this success, Schrab and Harmon founded their own comedy channel – simply named Channel 101 – later in 1999.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/9d581a8eda1d1c77-2048x1024-1024x512.jpg><h3>Dan Harmon’s “Story Circle”</h3><p>During the late 1990s, while working on various programs for his Channel 101, Dan began developing his own story-telling technique now referred to as “Story Circle”. Its framework is highly adaptable, and easily applicable to various broadcast formats, from TV series to movies, consisting of eight precise steps, including character introduction, their desires and eventually their adaptation to a new and unfamiliar situation, achieving their goal at a heavy price and, in the end, inner changes of a character as a result of their journey.</p><p>var RevContentSolo = { button_text: ‘Find Out More’, widget_id: 170813};</p><p>Dan Harmon’s Channel 101 earned a huge dose of popularity for its comedy web series’ such as the “Yacht Rock” about American soft rock superstars in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as for a sketch show named the “Acceptable.TV” which aired on VH1 in 2007, and for which Dan served not only as its creator but as the executive producer as well. Harmon also co-authored the screenplay for the Oscar-nominated animated horror comedy movie “Monster House”, and was a member of the writing staff and co-creator of the “The Sarah Silverman Program”.</p><h2>Dan Harmon’s Rise to Fame</h2><p>To a greater prominence Dan came in 2009 when his TV comedy series named “Community” premiered on NBC.

In May 2014, after five seasons NBC discontinued the show which was subsequently bought out by Yahoo! for one more season. During six seasons of airing, “Community” was honored with one Primetime Emmy Award in 2011, three Primetime Emmy Award nominations in 2012, 2014 and 2015, as well as with over 15 other awards and more than 65 various nominations in total. It is certain that all these accolades helped Dan Harmon to dramatically increase his fame.</p><h2>“Rick and Morty”</h2><p>The real breakthrough in Dan’s professional career occurred in late 2013, when he co-created the animated comedy <a rel=nofollow href=#>TV series</a> “Rick and Morty”. The show follows the adventures of a mean-spirited inventor and genius super scientist Rick Sanchez, and his good-hearted but not-so-bright grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between everyday leisure and ‘interdimensional’ journeys.

The show was honored with a Primetime Emmy Award in 2018 for Outstanding Animated Program, and is currently in its fourth season.</p><p>In addition, Dan Harmon has added several other accolades to his professional portfolio, which include producing, writing and even acting efforts on TV series such as the “Water and Power”, “Great Minds with Dan Harmon” as well as the “HarmonQuest”, “Good Game”, and more recently the “Harmontown”.</p><h2>Dan Harmon’s Personal Life</h2><p>Curious about Dan’s private life, aren’t you?
