Will this continue with jury members? If I was jury, that information would 100% impact my vote. So do they do it?”</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Naturally, Big Brother fans nationwide gave their theories as to how the relationship between Cirie and Jared would be handled as soon as the jury comes into play.</p><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>“Unlikely production/Julie will based on how twists/relationships have been handled in the past, but if Blue is in jury, she could reveal it to the other evicted houseguests (again, based on how these things have been handled in the past),” @BigBrother-ModTeam shared, explaining how with production aside, Jared’s showmance partner (or should we say former showmance partner?) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Kim</a> could be the one that spills the beans. With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Izzy Gleicher</a> out of the house, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she is the only one who knows their secret</a>!</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>If the jury is unaware that Cirie and Jared are a mother-son duo after all, @InfluenceVast6093 brought up an intriguing point that could potentially seal Cirie’s fate as the winner of Big Brother 25, should Jared be eliminated this Thursday (September 28): “If I was Cirie, I would use it as a talking point for my [final two] speech. It has the wow factor that grabs the jury’s attention.”</p><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>Some Reddit users agreed with this theory, such as @Dont_Be_Sheep, who emphasized just how important that final speech is by referencing the finale of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Brother 24</a>. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor [Hale]</a> won because her speech was 10 billion times better than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monte [Taylor]</a>, who came off as cocky. Even though he did do better in every single aspect than Taylor, his speech and answers turned everyone off. He didn’t even answer anything. Taylor was humble and explained her game. While not as impressive, she did a much better job. Guess who won? Not the person with all the comp wins and big moves… the one with the speech,” the Reddit user dished.</p><p data-characters=638 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>On the other hand, @CheesecakeOdd2087 had a great deal to say as to why this would be a bad thing for Cirie to share during her final two speech, should she make it that far: “I wouldn’t if I were her. I think it would hurt her chances of winning TBH. ‘Yeah, so this whole time my son Jared was here with me. Sorry to anyone who told him anything in confidence, not knowing he’d run straight to me and fill me in on everything.’ It would probably give the (accurate) impression that she had an unfair advantage over other competitors in the game, which I don’t think would help her in final two.”</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>With two arguments that are equally as credible, who knows what could happen — Cirie might not even make it to the final two!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jared-fields-big-brother-25.jpg><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=84 data-injectable=false>While Jared is not entirely in the game right now, don’t count him out either.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Having been eliminated alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Hardin</a> in a thrilling double eviction this past Thursday (September 21), with the infamous zombie twist, he could still make it back into the Big Brother house and outlast his fellow contestants until the very end.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>After being eliminated, Jared and Cameron returned to the house (or should we say Sound Stage 18 at CBS Studios in Los Angeles?) as&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;zombies this week. After a high-stakes competition this Thursday, only one of them will return to the game, while the other one will be evicted once and for all.</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>While it has yet to air on CBS, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron won the Resurrection Rumble competition</a>, despite the challenge being left on a cliffhanger. With another challenge on the horizon that determines who will stay and who will go, Cameron now has the power to decide to play himself or choose for Jared to compete. If the participating houseguest wins, then they will reenter the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;house for good, but if the participating houseguest loses, then the other zombie will get their game resurrected — it is sure to be a nail-biter of an episode!</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>To find out which zombie stays in the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;house, be sure to tune into CBS this Thursday at 9pm ET/PT. From then on, to see if Cirie or Jared makes it to the final two (and to see if their secret stays a secret), be sure to catch new episodes every Sunday, Wednesday, and Thursday — things are starting to get intense.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZK2glWKvqrOMm6morJiav25%2BlGahrqqpYq%2Bmecueq2ahnmK8r3nCoqminV2Wu6V5yZqpnpyjYsCmr9Geq2asmJp6tLzEnKylmaSevK95xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jen-potthast.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jen Potthast</a>
