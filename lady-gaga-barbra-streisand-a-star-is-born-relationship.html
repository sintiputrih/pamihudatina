With Lady Gaga being a thorough and well-knowledged pupil of both theater and film, she knew she had to speak with the last artist to take on the role before filming began.</p><p>Speaking with E! News, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbra said she did speak to the singer "a little bit"</a> about the role and gave her some pointers.

Really make it different again, different kind of music, integrated actors, I thought that was a great idea. So, I was surprised when I saw how alike it was to the version that I did in 1976," said Barbra.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Bradley Cooper 'Devastated' Lady Gaga While Filming 'A Star Is Born'</a></span></p><p>While she also said she couldn't argue with the success of the film, it's not what she focuses on.

"I think it is wonderful. She is wonderful. Bradley told me he spent months with her working to see her real self," said Barbra to Extra.</p><p>"It starts like my old movie, with the concert, and he goes to a club and finds her. But they were able to put some new things in it, which I liked." In another interview with Extra, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she went as far as to say she loved the film</a>.</p><p>There's also a behind-the-scenes video featured on the DVD of A Star Is Born that shows <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbra visiting Bradley and Gaga on set</a>, sharing laughs together, and seemingly having a great time.

"I feel Ally inside of me. I wonder how long she’ll stay. Or if she’ll be in there forever," said the actress to Variety in 2018. It makes sense that she would feel such a deep connection to the character after filming because she's admitted to basing aspects of the character on herself. "The character of Ally is informed by my life experience, but I also wanted to make sure that she was not me. It was a cadence of both," said Gaga in an interview with Elle Magazine.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lady Gaga's Audition For A Star Is Born Lasted For Hours</a></span></p><p>Bradley Cooper confirmed that the character is very much written in her image. "I wrote it for her, to play it. I asked her so many questions and wanted to mine so much of the things that she told me. That completely formed the creation of Ally," said Bradley to Elle Magazine. "We really were very vulnerable [together]. I had a lot of belief in her magic. It’s one thing to have a sense of it, and then watch it, before your eyes, every day, shooting."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmpypYrSis8BmmZqqkqeubr%2FTq5yiq5GjsW6tjKyrmqpdnsBurs6rpWaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./biggest-snake-ever.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fossilized Vertebrae Found In India Reveal Huge Prehistoric Snake</a>
