tonight that a lot of the fans have been requesting for the whole tour.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/swifferupdates/status/1695718789118366096</figure><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>Cornelia Street is the ninth track on Taylor‚Äôs seventh studio album, ‚ÄúLover‚Äù. The song is a fan favorite for Swifties, thanks to its sweet melodic pop sound and intriguing lyrics. The exact meaning of the song isn‚Äôt clear, but one thing fans know is that Cornelia Street is a real street in New York City‚Äôs West Village, and Taylor rented a home there while her usual residence in Tribeca was being renovated. This is even referenced in the song‚Äôs first verse, where Taylor says ‚ÄúI rent a place on Cornelia Street.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>While not confirmed, Cornelia Street is canonized by many Swifties to be about Taylor‚Äôs ex-BFF, supermodel Karlie Kloss. During their highly-publicized friendship, Taylor and Karlie both resided in New York City, and Karlie even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had a guest bedroom she frequented at Taylor‚Äôs home</a> for sleepovers. Karlie has also been speculated to have spent a lot of time at Taylor‚Äôs temporary home on Cornelia Street.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cornelia Street.. is where Karlie snuck in to see Taylor at her rented home on September 16th, 2016‚Ä¶ Two days before that Karlie was spotted with Taylor‚Äôs bodyguard after she worked out‚Ä¶ assuming it was on Cornelia Street as well‚Ä¶ü•∫ here we go ladies I‚Äôm digging <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rt9Xgbd8yb</a></p>‚Äî mal ‚ô°‚Äôs taylor (Pittsburgh n1!)

Although neither of them have ever publicly discussed the matter, the two are thought to have fallen out around the 2018 mark, and stopped appearing in public together. For many Swifties, Taylor and Karlie‚Äôs close, intense-seeming relationship was likely a romantic one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-karlie-kloss.png><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>This theory about their friendship was re-ignited in recent weeks when Karlie was spotted attending the final U.S. concert in the first leg of Taylor‚Äôs Eras Tour. Karlie has not been associated with Taylor for years, and her sudden re-appearance in Taylor‚Äôs sphere, in the nosebleed seats and away from the VIP area, came as a surprise for everyone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Karlie Kloss spotted at Taylor Swift‚Äôs Eras Tour. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HZbhW1YsJF</a></p>‚Äî Pop Base (@PopBase) <a href=#>August 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Perhaps no one was more surprised than Taylor herself, as the two former friends were not spotted together before or after the concert. In a later concert in Mexico City, Taylor‚Äôs performance of Cornelia Street struck many fans as being one filled with rage by the singer. Previously, fans have tracked surprise songs on the tour as having a meaning that Taylor wanted to convey to fans about how she‚Äôs feeling.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>she looks PISSED like this is cornelia street about to burn someone‚Äôs house down version <a href=#>https://t.co/qCzviFV5Ey</a></p>‚Äî maggie kate üåô (@taylorelaii) <a href=#>August 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>The lyrics of Cornelia Street tell the tale of a relationship based in New York City that has ended in heartbreak. The chorus in particular seems to relay Taylor and Karlie‚Äôs relationship, with Taylor singing ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the kind of heartbreak time could never mend/I‚Äôd never walk Cornelia Street again/And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Clearly, the former residence of Taylor ‚Äì and possibly Karlie ‚Äì is one that Taylor associates with a tough time in her life, and that she can never revisit without being overwhelmed by the memories of what was once there.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Cornelia Street is also speculated to be associated with the actor Joe Alwyn, Taylor‚Äôs boyfriend from 2016 to 2023. However, Lover was released in 2019, three years into their relationship. Given the song‚Äôs motif of a past relationship, the song‚Äôs meaning doesn‚Äôt seem to coincide with Taylor and Joe‚Äôs relationship ‚Äì at least, in the common interpretation among Taylor‚Äôs fans.</p><p data-characters=682 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=false>When Lover was first released, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor cited Cornelia Street</a> as the track that was closest to her heart. Heartfelt, however, does not always mean romantic. There is every chance that the song could be about a platonic relationship. Whether or not Taylor and Karlie were something more than friends is a private matter, and it does not change the overall idea of a once-beautiful relationship falling apart, against a city backdrop. Taylor‚Äôs ability to convey ideas to her fans through lyrics and easter eggs for them to follow is one of her greatest strengths, so perhaps the popular belief about Cornelia Street is exactly the story Taylor wanted to tell her beloved Swifties.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqcBuv86nnmabn6e7prjImmSsrKKasrV5wJumrqxf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fast-and-the-furious-look-back-at-the-franchise-201524.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Fast and Furious' Franchise Through the Years: Photos</a>
