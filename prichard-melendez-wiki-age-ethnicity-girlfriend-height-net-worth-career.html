In addition, he won the gold medal in the 64 kg category at the 2010 Pan American Youth Championship. In the year 2012, Prichard made the decision to become a professional fighter.</p><p>On February 23, 2013, he made his professional debut. As a result, his first fight took place at the Cosme Beita Salamo Coliseum in Catao, Puerto Rico, against Xavier La Salle. In the first round, he knocked out LaSalle. Similarly, he distinguished himself for his erratic schedule. Furthermore, he fought five times in 2013 and seven times in 2014.</p><p>Furthermore, his most notable fight occurred on September 9, 2015, when he faced Vivian Harris, a more experienced fighter. On October 17, 2015, he was scheduled to face Terrel Williams in an undercard fight at the EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia.</p><p>He and Terrell Williams fought for nine rounds, with him appearing to be ahead in the first five. Throughout the match, Williams repeatedly illegally punched him in the back of the head. He also told the referee about the illegal punches to the back of his head, to which the referee responded, “You take care of it.” Colón, on the other hand, hit Williams with a low blow, for which he was docked two points.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-on-career></span>More On Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>During the ninth round, he was knocked down for the first time in his professional career after a series of illegal blows. Between rounds, he spoke to the ringside doctor, Richard Ashby, and stated that he felt dizzy but that he could continue. Colón was given the all-clear by the doctor, allowing the fight to continue. He was disqualified after the ninth round after his corner mistakenly removed his gloves, thinking the fight was over.</p><p>Furthermore, his supporters claimed he was incoherent and dizzy. He was vomiting after the fight and was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with brain bleeding there. As a result, he spent 221 days in a coma.

Colón’s mother also stated that he was learning to communicate using a computer. She does, however, continue to upload videos of his progress to YouTube.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=prichard-melendez-girlfriend-dating></span>Prichard Melendez Girlfriend, Dating<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His marital status is single and unmarried.
