However, he soon left the London team.</p><p>On 6 January 2016, it was announced that Farrell would take over as Ireland’s defensive coach after the conclusion of the 2016 Six Nations Championship, because his previous contract with the England team prevented him from working with an international team until April 2016, Farrell joined the Irish province of Munster in January 2016 in a four-month temporary advisory role.</p><p>On 26 November 2018, it was announced that Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt would step down after the 2019 Rugby World Cup, with Farrell taking over as head coach.
