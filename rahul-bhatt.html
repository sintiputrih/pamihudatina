Rahul’s father, Bittaje Bhat, cried a lot in front of the camera while answering questions about his son.

In terms of religion, Rahul Bhatt (Kashmiri Pandit) was both a Hindu and a Kashmiri Pandit. In his life, he practiced Hinduism.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Following Rahul’s death, it was revealed in the media that he worked as a Revenue Officer in the Budgam district. On May 12, 2022, he was killed by his officer. Terrorists approached his office, asked for his name, and then shot him with their guns. The media has raised the question of how terrorists learned Rahul’s name. Previously, Rahul’s wife Meenakshi Bhatt stated in an interview that Rahul felt insecure as a Chadoora Tehsildar officer in Budgam.</p><p>She revealed that Rahul had also requested that the local administration relocate him to headquarters for the next two years.
