Given his good looks, it is no surprise that fans are always interested in his dating life. Here is all you need to know about him.</p><p class=dh>The "John Tucker Must Die" actor was born in Canada on April 8, 1981. As a child growing up in Canada, he wanted to be an actor, and his aspirations made him travel to the United States in 2002 after IMG Models scouted him.</p><p class=dh>While working as a model, he became a certified personal trainer and nutritionist. In 2004, Taylor Kitsch, who was once homeless and had to sleep on subway trains, moved from New York to Los Angeles to study the art of acting with coach Sheila Gray.</p><p class=dh>In 2006, Kitsch, who was once a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Taylor-Kitsch-Fun-Facts-37240367?stream_view=1#photo-37240375">dedicated</a> hockey player, got his big break when he starred in "The Covenant," as fans got to know him more, and he became more recognized.</p><p class=dh>In February 2009, Kitsch signed on to play the role of Gambit in the "X-Men" franchise spin-off "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" and subsequently <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2018237/>starred</a> in films like "The Bang Bang Club," "John Carter," "Battleship," and more. As his fame grew, fans also became interested in the women in his life.</p><p class=dh>Even with fame, Kitsch is a humble guy who prefers to skip the tabloid craze. He spends his free time doing children's charity work, listening to music, and spending time with family and friends.</p><p class=dh>The actor, who also has a sensitive side, is friends with Hollywood's A-list, has never been married, and has no child. Even though he prefers to be private about his relationships, there have been a few known women in his life.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>TAYLOR KITSCH RELATIONSHIP WITH RACHEL MCADAMS</strong></p><p class=dh>In 2015, there were rumors that Kitsch was dating actress Rachel McAdams, his "True Detective" co-star. The rumors <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rachel-mcadams-and-taylor-kitsch-are-dating-201517/>started</a> after they dined at Osteria Mozza in West Hollywood.</p><p class=dh>Multiple sources said they had been friends for years and confirmed the relationship though they believed it was not serious. McAdams and Kitsch had grown closer on set and were talking with each other constantly.</p><p class=dh>McAdams said she found the things the internet proclaimed as being funny and weird, especially when it had to do with her dating life. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/news/167902_rachel_mcadams_on_taylor_kitsch_dating_rumors>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"[It's the] weird, weird, bizarre, surreal side of it, but I guess you just have to laugh at it at a certain point."</p><p class=dh>However, she did not confirm or deny the rumors and also did not give a straight answer about her possible new relationship with Kitsch. She laughed off the reports and said being photographed with a man does not automatically make them a couple.</p><p class=dh>While McAdams did not address the rumors directly, Kitsch put the rumors to sleep when he attended an event. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/news/169112_taylor_kitsch_addresses_rachel_mcadams_dating_rumors>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"There is no record. There is nothing to set straight. She's an amazing actress and a great gal."</p><p class=dh>In the past, McAdams had <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/rachel-mcadams-glamour-magazine-cover-interview-ok-we-love-this-girl>revealed</a> that the set was not a good place for romance, as it was too distracting and not conducive. She further stated that she had not dated anyone while they were on set but after the shooting.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>TAYLOR KITSCH HAS BEEN RUMORED TO DATE CO-STAR MINKA KELLY</strong></p><p class=dh>Minka Kelly was born in California on June 24, 1980, but grew up in New Mexico. After high school, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1310368/>moved</a> to Los Angeles to pursue her acting hobby but wanted to become a surgical technician.</p><p class=dh>She fell in love with her hobby, and when she co-starred in "Friday Night Lights" with Kitsch, there were rumors that he dated the actress just as their characters fell for each other on the show. They had met when they co-starred on the show in 2006.</p><p class=dh>There is no information about their relationship, and none of them responded to the rumors. The rumors started because they had an excellent onscreen relationship. While talking about their characters, Kelly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/photos/21621/minka-kelly-s-romantic-history>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I think [Tim] is probably the love of [Lyla's] life. I don't know, maybe they do end up back together, [...] and they work things out."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>TAYLOR KITSCH HAS MANY RUMORED RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p class=dh>In 2010, after a sexy <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq.com/gallery/sexiest-couples-photos>photoshoot</a> for GQ magazine, there were rumors that Kitsch was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/friday-night-lights-casts-dating-histories-minka-kelly-more/>dating</a> fashion model, actress, and television personality, Jessica White.</p><p class=dh>White, born in 1984, has had minor roles in movies like "Big Momma's House 2" and has starred in music videos for Jay-Z, John Legend, Trey Songs, and more. She has also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924965/>worked</a> with world-class photographers and has done editorials for Teen Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and more.</p><p class=dh>According to the rumors, Kitsch has also dated former Miss Universe Australia, Laura Csortan. Csortan is a model, TV host, and beauty queen who <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/dating/laura-csortan-reveals-brutal-experience-dating-younger-men/news-story/5cf2c826bead59845ab90aef725a3a55>represented</a> her country and made it to the top 10 at the 1997 Miss World pageant.

He's very private about his personal life. Kitsch once revealed that finding love as an actor was hard. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/news/166483_taylor_kitsch_reveals_he_slept_on_the_subway_before_his_big_break>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"How do you build a relationship with a gal and then tell her, 'Hey, I gotta do press all over the world. I expect you to have the same feelings you have now in eight weeks."</p><p class=dh>He said it was his choice. However, the actor, who will feature in "The Terminal List" with <a class="me a" href=#>Chris Pratt</a>, hopes the sacrifices he has made by choosing his career over love will be worth it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwa2hja3q1rdilpqtlm57BtK%2FHrGSdmaSeu6h5y6KdnmaYqbqt</p></div><div id=links><a href=./title-voletta-wallace-introduces-notorious-b-i-g-to-the-metaverse.html>&#171;&nbsp;Biggie Smalls Has A Hyperrealistic Avatar In The Metaverse</a>
