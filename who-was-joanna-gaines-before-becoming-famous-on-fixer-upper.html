It's unclear how many kids Teresa has (at least one, per Hello Magazine), but Mikey had six as of 2018.</p><p>Joanna's mom is Korean while her dad is German-Lebanese; Gaines confirmed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they met while her father was stationed in Korea in the military</a>.</p><p>That means Joanna is half Korean, a quarter German, and a quarter Lebanese, although she is a US citizen from birth.</p><p>Joanna once wrote on Instagram that her parents' love story (and 45-year+ marriage) was an inspiration to her, especially because the two had hard times early on. Originally, Joanna explained that her parents met at a party, but it later turned out that it was a "pot party," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaines admitted in her podcast</a>.</p><p>In the first year of their marriage, Joanna's dad was into drugs, but when his mother passed away, she explained, her dad realized he wasn't living life right and decided to change things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Chip And Joanna Gaines' Relationship Anywhere Near As Wholesome As Fixer Upper Makes It Out To Be?</a></span></p><p>Her dad wound up getting a job at Firestone, which led to him eventually having his own tire shop—where Joanna's photo was displayed, which led to Chip eventually meeting her.</p><p>Joanna also appeared in a commercial for the Firestone shop, but that was her only TV gig prior to hitting it big with HGTV.</p><p>Things didn't always come easily for Joanna Stevens, as she explained in her podcast while chatting with her mom about her early life.</p><h2 id=joanna-gaines-took-time-to-embrace-her-heritage>Joanna Gaines Took Time To Embrace Her Heritage</h2><p>In her podcast, Joanna actually apologized to her mom for not fully embracing her Korean heritage, saying to Nan, "I always wanted to say I was sorry for living in halfness.

Since then, she's appeared in countless spinoffs and specials under the Magnolia umbrella; Chip and Joanna have released numerous TV shows on Magnolia, some starring friends of theirs from the industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Any Of The Magnolia Network TV Shows As Successful As Fixer Upper?</a></span></p><p>Joanna mostly sticks to home DIY and cooking content, including Magnolia Table, which has proven to be a hit. After all, cooking is one of Joanna's passions and the reason why the Magnolia Market features a bakery in addition to home goods and other HGTV-inspired stores.</p><p>Her show also allowed her the opportunity to hire her sister on to Magnolia when the brand blew up; Mikey and Joanna have collaborated on Ferny's, a "retro plant shop," per Hello Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecmomKemkWK0orXNnqpmmpWbvLOxjJucnKednruoecWapKito2K8r3nFoq%2Beql2qvbGx0Wg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-was-the-jackie-robinson-statue-stolen-and-who-took-it.html>&#171;&nbsp;Why was the Jackie Robinson statue stolen, and who took it?</a>
