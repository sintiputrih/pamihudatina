Colour Brain: Disney Edition</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Colour-Brain-Disney-Edition-460x360.jpg><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Colour Brain is a very unique twist on a trivia game. It gives each player a hand of 11 cards, each one representing a different color. Each question asks players to remember the color of an object or outfit, and players answer by playing the corresponding color card. What makes Colour Brain super fun is the scoring system.

Disney Villainous</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Disney-Villainous-540x360.jpg><p data-characters=763 data-current-count=1063 data-injectable=true>The Disney villains are some of the most iconic characters in cinema and pop-culture history.

Your aim is to complete your character’s goal before any other player completes theirs, making this a fast and frantic race against time. However, just because your goals and boards are different, it doesn’t mean you can’t engage in some skullduggery to mess with other players, as the Fate deck contains cards that allow you to put roadblocks in front of other villains.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The fact that each villain has their own board and goal gives this game a lot of replay value as you try to work out the best strategy for each character.
