The singer is also the first Black man to obtain EGOT status for his many contributions to the industry. Recently, he made headlines when he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ascended to top-1 percent status</a> based on his enormous wealth, so where does his net worth come from?</p><h2 id=h-brief-history data-injectable=false>Brief history</h2><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=906 data-injectable=true>Legend, also known as John Stephens, was born on Dec. 28, 1978, in Springfield, Ohio, to a seamstress named Phyllis Stephens and Ronald Stephens, a factory worker. Legend is the second oldest of three children. The “All of Me” singer’s love for the arts began early because he came from a musically inclined family. Growing up, Legend and his family were highly involved in the church. His mother would sing and direct the church choir while his father and brother played the drums. As for Legend, he sang and learned how to play the piano.</p><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>He was homeschooled on and off until high school,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would attend North High School at 12</a>&nbsp;after skipping two grades. After graduating high school at 16 years old, he left his hometown and went to the University of Pennsylvania. He would ultimately graduate from college with an English degree in 1999. That following year, Legend moved to New York and began professionally pursuing music by performing in nightclubs. During those performances, he sold his self-produced work by giving fans a copy of his CDs—”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Stephens” and “Live at Johnny’s”</a>—in 2000 and 2001.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Also in 2001, The “Tonight” vocalist would have a life-changing encounter after meeting rapper and former friend Kanye West. Immediately following that introduction, Legend started playing the piano and singing background vocals for other artists. The list included Alicia Keys, Talib Kwali, and The Black Eyed Peas.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Legend’s career started to pick up drastically in 2004 after working on West’s debut album, “College Dropout.” That same year, West launched his record label, G.O.O.D. Music, with Sony BMG, and Legend was the company’s first act. His debut album, “Get Lifted,” was released in December 2004. The record, which spawned the hit single, “Ordinary People,” earned him two Grammy awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>His musical success continued to soar as he won numerous Grammys for other albums released from 2006 to 2020. The list includes “Once Again,” “Evolver,” “Wake Up!,” “Love in the Future,” “Darkness and Light,” and “Bigger Love.” To date, Legend is reported to have sold 10 million records worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>His accomplishments didn’t stop there. The singer would go on to win a Golden Globe and an Oscar for the track, “Glory,” that he and rapper Common wrote and collaborated on for the&nbsp;Selma movie soundtrack. Legend’s other professional accolades include a Tony Award for co-producing the play,&nbsp;Jitney, and an Emmy Award for his work on the live rock rendition of&nbsp;Jesus Christ Superstar.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Despite conflicting reports, many outlets claim that Legend is<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;worth about $100 million.</a>&nbsp;It is also reported that Legend’s net worth is a combined total with his wife, Chrissy Teigen, with the singer making the bulk of the money.
